Instead of going to Vietnam, Wordsworth goes off to fight against the French while Coleridge stays at home and promotes utopianism. After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.	0.165367	[{"name": "Arts Council of England", "id": 718}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}]	6/29/2001	0	124	[{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}]	Released		Pandaemonium	4.5	2

A copyist is urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.	5.062687	[{"name": "Sidney Kimmel Entertainment", "id": 737}, {"name": "Anomaly Entertainment", "id": 739}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}]	9/10/2006	0	104	[{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}]	Released		Copying Beethoven	6.2	42
