Yet, while research proves that teachers are the most important school factor in a child's future success, America's teachers are so woefully underpaid that almost a third must divide their time between a second job in order to make a living. Chronicling the stories of four teachers in different areas of the country, American Teacher reveals the frustrating realities of today's educators, the difficulty of attracting talented new teachers, and why so many of our best teachers feel forced to leave the profession altogether. But this wake-up call to our system's failings also looks at possibilities for reform. Can we re-value teaching in the United States and turn it into a prestigious, financially attractive and competitive profession? With almost half of American teachers leaving the field in the next five years, now is the time to find out.	0.488224	/pZ968Ej2LXZnyAWreY1ButvUbwN.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	5/3/2011	0	81	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released	Dedicated.

An impressionistic, black-and-white portrait of the day-to-day of a nonagenarian woman as she experiences the final act of her life. Danuta Szaflarska stars as Aniela, who lives in a massive yet rapidly-deteriorating wooden house, filled with souvenirs and treasures of eras gone by. Aniela runs into conflict in her dealings with others, particularly a nasty neighbor who sees her property as an eyesore and wants to do everything in his reach to buy it up and tear it down, and her married adult son, who - though kindly - triggers paranoia within Aniela (she cannot help but believe that he is scheming and planning to wheedle the property away from her). Driven aback by these individuals, Aniela finds one of her only sources of comfort and reassurance in her daily talks with her dog, Fila - and develops a great affinity for spying on the neighbors' doings whenever boredom creeps in.	0.37798	/k1tPG9JZZMe1cFYLv0R4utx6D0d.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'PL', 'name': 'Poland'}]	10/19/2007	0	104	[{'iso_639_1': 'pl', 'name': 'Polski'}]	Released		Time to Die	FALSE	5.9	4
