For six years the filmmaker worked with unprecedented access to some of the most venomous ideologies and violent conflicts of our time including the white supremacist movement, Christian Fundamentalism as an anti-gay platform, Muslim extremism, the Palestinian Intifada, Israeli settlers and soldiers, and US Forces in Iraq. By juxtaposing this verite footage with interviews from leading sociological, psychological, and neurological experts, and interspersing stories of redemption told by former "combatants", the film weaves a tapestry that reveals both the emotional and biological mechanisms which make all of us susceptible to acts and ideologies of hate, and demonstrates how these very same traits make us equally capable of overcoming them.	0.110588	/6h6QMvBIwbXF2cS3L2v0sEGH3aG.jpg	[]	[]	4/21/2009	0	86	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released		The Anatomy of Hate	FALSE	5.7	3

He also does an amusing re-enactment of some scenes from 300. Murphy goes on to criticize the usual rehabilitation treatments ensuing from celebrity meltdowns (e.g., Mel Gibson and Michael Richards), arguing that an experience with Jigsaw from Saw is the only way to cure these people of their prejudices. Sticking with celebrities, he claims that Britney Spears's strange behaviour in 2007-08 was caused by her being possessed by the spirit of Rick James. In addition, Charlie hits on reality television, making fun of the courage (or lack thereof) of Dog the Bounty Hunter as well as an obsession with The Dog Whisperer.	0.360583	/pRhiLkVtej18W1ZX6ZgecMkTurF.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	1/1/2010	0	63	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released		Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize	FALSE	5	5

Two traditionally rival Turkish families, "Seferoglu"s and "Tellioglu"s are competing for the "Green Valley". The winner will be determined by Daver Bey, who has a beautiful young daughter, Leyla. Both families try to arrange a marriage between a man from their family and Leyla, so that Daver Bey will be inclined to give the green valley to his "relatives". Tellioglus, who are behind in the race, desperately find a final solution: They will fake their idiotic butler, Saban, as the highest ranked Ottoman soldier in Egypt: Tosun Pasha.	0.91597	/t4U4qK2Iqn2gJSP22HZVBkTQBT2.jpg	[{'name': 'Arzu Film', 'id': 4639}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'TR', 'name': 'Turkey'}]	1/1/1976	698200	94	[{'iso_639_1': 'tr', 'name': 'TÃ¼rkÃ§e'}]	Released	Green Valley is ours!

Vinicius, a young patrician, falls in love with the beautiful Lygia, the daughter of a Barbarian commander who was killed in battle, and wants her for his concubine. For Lygia, a Christian, being a pagan's concubine is a severe sin and disgrace. However, when Vinicius is wounded, Lygia cares for him, and starts to reciprocate his feelings. Vinicius, in return, becomes interested in Christian learning and asks Apostle Peter to teach him. In the meantime, Emperor Nero accuses Christians of having started a great fire in Rome. He encourages the imprisonment, torture and murder of his Christian subjects.	1.212036	/hjqUYv6WK4dADFmRBcd5MQUl6k9.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'PL', 'name': 'Poland'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	8/30/2001	0	170	[{'iso_639_1': 'pl', 'name': 'Polski'}]	Released		Quo Vadis	FALSE	5.2	9

After an official meeting on the next day being part of the PR campaign the shaman suffers from a heart attack. Hardly being able to speak and laying in a hospital bed he demands to see Perrin. The latter is not very interested in meeting the shaman again. However it looks like it is to late for animosities as the shaman and Perrin seem to be tied mentally somehow since they've met in the elevator.	2.62384	/4hXnG2Onkgehz1D4Y6Qps7GE9lU.jpg	[{'name': 'TF1 Films Production', 'id': 3823}, {'name': 'Canal+', 'id': 5358}, {'name': 'Gaumont International', 'id': 7961}, {'name': 'EFVE', 'id': 11037}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]	10/9/1996	0	100	[{'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'FranÃ§ais'}]	Released		Le Jaguar	FALSE	5.5	56

 At some point in the distant future, a massive, catastrophic earthquake strikes Tokyo, causing the temperature of the Pacific Ocean to rise meteorically and the largest typhoon in recorded Japanese history to sweep toward the city and inundate it with water. The Tokyo Fire Department and its team of crack rescuers swing into action, and shortly after they do, a distress call arises from an underground subway station - with repeated indications of the rescue code, 252 252, and the exclamation "We Have Survivors." It soon becomes apparent that the local rescue squad must attempt to save the survivors, doing so at the expense of their own lives and safety.

FALSE		0	[]		409926	tt0081846	en	Cosmos	Astronomer Dr. Carl Sagan is host and narrator of this 13-hour series that originally aired on Public Broadcasting Stations in the United States. Dr. Sagan describes the universe in a way that appeals to a mass audience, by using Earth as a reference point, by speaking in terms intelligible to non-scientific people, by relating the exploration of space to that of the Earth by pioneers of old, and by citing such Earth legends as the Library of Alexandria as metaphors for space-related future events. Among Dr. Sagan's favorite topics are the origins of life, the search for life on Mars, the infernal composition of the atmosphere of Venus and a warning about a similar effect taking place on Earth due to global pollution and the "greenhouse effect", the lives of stars, interstellar travel and the effects of attaining the speed of light, the danger of mankind technologically self-destructing, and the search, using radio technology, for intelligent life in deep space.	0.282584	/mYrnDinyVDhWatHYSwADTTYqoMG.jpg	[]	[]		0	60	[]	Released		Cosmos	FALSE	9.1	41

His master, Ivan Ivanovich, a man far from being young, fond of hunting and nature, took a puppy to live with him, despite the dog's black ear being a "shame of nature" to his breed. The man always took his dog, whom he called Bim or Bimka, to hunting in country. Later, however Ivan Ivanovich began to have problems with heart and when the disease became worse was taken to a hospital. His dog couldn't bear waiting for the only person that ever cared for him and set out to find his master. Thus began the story of a homeless dog and his many breathtaking and exciting adventures, encounters of many people, kind and evil, and leads to an unexpected and heart-rending end.	1.185288	/481ib7CvWnEFobSMSzGrsoNoxtY.jpg	[{'name': 'Gorky Film Studios', 'id': 21978}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'RU', 'name': 'Russia'}]	9/15/1977	0	0	[{'iso_639_1': 'ru', 'name': 'PÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹'}]	Released		White Bim Black Ear	FALSE	6.9	9
