Kuchu Teien is, on the face of it, more a drama, a character study, than a typical Toyoda genre flick. Yet within this beautifully structured and photographed film, there lies a dark soul. Ostensibly the story of a happy family, it becomes increasingly clear as the movie progresses that the Kyobashis are anything but. Despite a family agreement that they are all open with each other, the entire household knows the opposite is true.	0.836703	/wdPjgMtaFF1BVgIZMkJKLc3ilSv.jpg	[{'name': 'Asmik Ace Entertainment', 'id': 3033}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'JP', 'name': 'Japan'}]	10/8/2005	0	114	[{'iso_639_1': 'ja', 'name': 'æ—¥æœ¬èªž'}]	Released		Hanging Garden	FALSE	7.4	7

But Kaname isn't as boring as it seems on the surface. Not with characters around like Shimeko, a girl genius with a childlike lack of propriety, and her ace fisherman/folk-singer dad. Or the overbearing and unpleasant local Shinto priest, a former Christian cultist. Or Endo, Kazuya's new colleague, a bitter drunk after his son's suicide. Or Kin, a former terrorist, now a hermit on his boat engaging in secret "research." Or perhaps most importantly Teruko, the hypnotically beautiful bar owner, the focus of all manner of innuendo and intrigue.
