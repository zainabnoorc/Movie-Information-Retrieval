Guttuart goes to Gergovia, the capital of the Arvenes tribe, to attend a meeting of Gallic tribal chieftains. The young boy Vercingetorix, along with his friend the young girl Eponia, sneak into a large cavern where Celtill, Vercingetorix's father and chieftain of the Arvenes, hosts the meeting of chieftains with the intention of proclaiming himself king of all Gauls. When Celtill shows off the crown once worn by the old kings of Gaul, an arrow from two Roman spies (dressed as Gauls) hits Celtill in the back.	1.050541	/84DIckAVzoT3dBkZtII2flYONJ1.jpg	[{'name': 'TÃ©lÃ©film Canada', 'id': 806}, {'name': 'M6 Films', 'id': 1115}, {'name': 'TF1 International', 'id': 7799}, {'name': 'Centre National de la CinÃ©matographie (CNC)', 'id': 18367}, {'name': 'Eiffel Productions', 'id': 44510}, {'name': 'Transfilm', 'id': 48188}, {'name': 'La MutualitÃ© FranÃ§aise', 'id': 87606}, {'name': 'SMK Limited', 'id': 87607}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'BE', 'name': 'Belgium'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]	1/24/2001	0	124	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'FranÃ§ais'}]	Released		The Gaul	FALSE	2.9	12

The film wonderfully blends both lyricism and politics and uses its central construct to build a montage praising Ukrainian industrialisation, attacking the European bourgeoisie, celebrating the beauty of the Ukrainian steppe and re-telling ancient folklore. Zvenigora is a most remarkable avant-garde film, which has a unique style in its approach and disregards the more traditional storytelling devices.

For him, censorship is both an art and a game, but he does not enjoy it. During a screening of a sentimental Polish melodrama called "Daybreak" at the Liberty cinema across the road from the censor's office, the actors start to rebel and refuse to speak their lines. There is anarchy and when the censor is unable to control the situation, senior party officials are called in. Eventually a film critic notes that the situation reminds of "The Purple Rose of Cairo" by Woody Allen and brings a reel of the film to demonstrate. The officials watch the film with amusement until another mix-up occurs: the second projector is turned on accidentally and superimposes "Daybreak" over "Purple Rose".	1.288561	/3pYKTsr8cng3dNeB6tNRQZCR0hM.jpg	[{'name': 'Crone Film Produktion A/S', 'id': 3677}, {'name': 'ZespÃ³l Filmowy "Tor"', 'id': 7984}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'PL', 'name': 'Poland'}]	10/14/1990	0	92	[]	Released		Escape from the 'Liberty' Cinema	FALSE	5.2	3
