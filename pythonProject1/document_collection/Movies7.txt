We follow Diana and Julian as they prepare for the arrival of Alex and Timo, who they have invited to their home for the weekend. Diana is nervous. As soon as she is confronted with the self-confident and ravishingly sexy Alex, her insecurity increases even more. Timo seems disinterested, a sharp contrast to the boyish excitement of Julian. But as night falls and their sexual exploration begins, we notice Timo may not be as casual as he initially seemed and Diana on the other hand contains hidden strength. And so we realize there's more to 'Swingers' than just sex.

Panic transforms into fear with every passing minute, situation is getting out of control. The lift cage transforms into closed space, into moving rattrap from which there is no escape. How would the five people behave in such hopeless situation? Their souls are assaulted by doubts and fear, they are filled with overwhelming feeling of inevitability and despair as around them the ordinary is turning into the unreal.

First Arrest (Mina olin siin. 1. esimene arrest, 2005), one of the most important Estonian works of literature of recent years. Seventeen-year-old Rass is growing up in an Estonian suburb. In the absence of a solid home life his family becomes a group of youngsters who are verging on being thieves. Drugs are an inseparable part of their lives, and when Rass agrees to distribute them, he gets tangled up in the narcotics trade. Small amounts suddenly become two-kilo packages that the mafia, to the misfortune of all involved, has not been paid for, and is ready to collect on by forceâ€¦ This story of one boyâ€™s adolescence unwinds retrospectively over a sheet of paper on which Rass records his memories while in prison. The camera intermediates these recollections in a nervous journalistic stylisation, often even duplicating the images, which increases the pace of the story, a true-to-life basis for which can be easily imagined.	0.285214	/l4GAfRUagiUySPiEowWdwPuyZWu.jpg	[{'name': 'Amrion', 'id': 4349}, {'name': 'Helsinki Filmi Oy', 'id': 6159}, {'name': 'Eesti Televisioon', 'id': 6182}, {'name': 'Nelonen', 'id': 20876}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'EE', 'name': 'Estonia'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'FI', 'name': 'Finland'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'TW', 'name': 'Taiwan'}]	9/12/2008	0	95	[{'iso_639_1': 'et', 'name': 'Eesti'}]	Released		I Was Here	FALSE	5.9	4

Blurring the lines between fact and fiction, truth and artifice, and between documentary and drama, Gaglianone has created a film within a film. You see the apparent artifice of Gaglianoneâ€™s crew using professionals, including the noted film actor Valerio Mastandrea as the teacher, interlinked with â€˜realâ€™ immigrant protagonists, studying the language to improve their chances of employment and of gaining a permanent residence permit. Thus in the course of the lessons there is simultaneously the painful and upsetting relation of the studentsâ€™ personal stories but also humour, as they interact and share their humanity, bridging cultural differences, united in their striving to make a better life for themselves.

In order to particularly grab the wandering flock, a priest invites the comedians from "The Other Sunday," an actual comedy program on Italian television, to perform on this new channel. He sets up a show that parodies an over-the-hill transvestite group, the Flagg Sisters, played by themselves. This understandably upsets one of the more eminent Cardinals who tries every means he can to stop the show. Nothing succeeds, and he can only assemble with all the other devout men of God to view the first live broadcast.

She eagerly absorbs routines, masters drills, and even pierces her own ears to fit in. Itâ€™s the joy of her first friendships and her discovery of dance. Shortly after Toni joins the team, most of the girls on the team suffer from episodes of fainting, swooning, and shaking in a seemingly uncontrollable catharsis. Nobody can explain the mysterious outbreak. These fits soon transform into a rite of passage as the trauma draws the other girls closer together. Caught between her need for control and her desire for acceptance, Toni must decide how far she will go to embody her new ideals.	2.915106	/h1GnE0znG21aepA8oSYcZDqX8Du.jpg	[{'name': 'Oscilloscope Laboratories', 'id': 4748}, {'name': "Yes Ma'am Productions", 'id': 62784}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	1/22/2016	0	71	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released		The Fits	FALSE	6.7	44

Low-budget but high-concept, War Book is a terse drama of interpersonal politics with rat-a-tat-tat dialogue and sharp performances. (12 Angry Men, Sleuth and The Deal all feel like reference points.) Created by some of the UKâ€™s most promising talents in down time between other projects, director/producer Tom Harper (Scouting Book for Boys, Woman in Black 2), screenwriter Jack Thorne (Skins, Scouting Book) and producer Lauren Dark bring together a top notch cast (including Sophie Okonedo, Ben Chaplin and Kerry Fox). Cold war anxiety is given contemporary relevance in this exploration of government arrogance and lack of accountability, and the terrifying fragility of world order when faced with the abyss of mutual destruction.	1.860646	/p2gEfTwQSfb646ai3Fv0Q9CzU7g.jpg	[{'name': 'Sixteen Films', 'id': 12695}, {'name': "Archer's Mark", 'id': 30601}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}]	10/13/2014	0	95	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released		War Book	FALSE	5.6	7
