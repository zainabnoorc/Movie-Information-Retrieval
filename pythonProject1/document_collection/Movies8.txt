This peculiar spaghetti western from prolific director Demofilo Fidani (using the pseudonym "Miles Deem") deals with a man named Blonde (Chet Davis) tracking bounty hunter Lazar (Hunt Powers) to the mining town of Lamazos. The evil town boss, Barret (Gordon Mitchell), wants Lazar dead, so he sends a group of assassins to murder him. Lazar survives, and Barret ends up offering him $100,000 to leave town. Lazar accepts the money and travels on to a remote shack, where he tortures an old man (Ettore Manni), making him a slave. What Lazar doesn't know is that the old man is Blonde's father, and he pays for his mistake with his life, leaving the man and his gunslinging son rich after the obligatory showdown. Fidani's film is unusual in its almost hallucinatory lack of logic, creating a surreal effect aided by the cinematography of Aristide Massaccesi, who would go on to some notoriety as cult director "Joe D'Amato."	0.148033	/9TAVu9VcXT2dgEWH6TbfTCfalvZ.jpg	[]	[]	11/27/1970	0	97	[]	Released		The Stranger That Kneels Beside the Shadow of a Corpse	FALSE	6	1

In the first novel, "Scherzo alla polacca", a shrewd son, trying to preserve his skin, ultimately becomes a hero and finds a reason for fighting. He initially tries to avoid underground training to avoid the Warsaw uprising. His drunkenness, disregard for safety and cowardice when sober stated with humorous effect come out as something sane in the world gone mad. His will to survive is more acceptable than any desire for heroic death. The second novel, "Ostinato lugubre", details a hopeless attempt at escape from a prison camp by a man who can no longer stand the confinement and idiocy of the professional soldiers trying to keep up the military preneses in prison. Nevertheless, his escape boosts the morale of his fellow prisoners, while the "escapee" lies hidden from Germans and comrades alike."

He meets a few main characters, besides his family, that shape his development - gangster Oni-ken (Susumu Terajima) and his hostess girlfriend, an ominous-looking Catholic priest and his congregation-of-one, the troubled and rebellious teenage girl Eri - who also becomes Shuji's classmate and the object of his adolescent affections. Life in the Shore/Offshore community is not a bundle of joy - the impression is of a community and lifestyle in decay, with the only hope of rejuvenation being a gangster-funded hotel development project that doesn't exactly inspire the locals either.

Max Perkins, literary editor at Scribnerâ€™s Sons is the first to sign such subsequent literary greats as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. When a sprawling, chaotic 1,000-page manuscript by an unknown writer named Thomas Wolfe falls into his hands, Perkins is convinced he has discovered a literary genius. Together the two men set out to work on a version for publication and a seemingly endless struggle over every single phrase ensues. During this process, Perkins the gentle family man and Wolfe the eccentric author become close â€“ a relationship eyed with suspicion by their wives. When â€˜Look Homeward, Angelâ€™ becomes a resounding success, the writer grows increasingly paranoid.	11.451354	/nwnmZkRkXpu11Zfku8DUSRu7JWs.jpg	[{'name': 'Desert Wolf Productions', 'id': 25986}, {'name': 'Michael Grandage Company', 'id': 53341}, {'name': 'Pinewood Pictures', 'id': 62230}, {'name': 'Riverstone Pictures', 'id': 76314}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	6/10/2016	5681622	104	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released	Max Perkins discovered Ernest Hemingway and F.

Embracing radically modernist narrative techniques, Golden Mouth offers a splintered, refractive portrait of brutal masculinity that returns repeatedly to the same moment from different vantages, each time revealing unexpected perspectives on the brutal yet strangely charming criminal. Lurid and disturbing, Golden Mouth delivers a savage satire of marriage and class pretensions, revealing a similar venality at the corroded heart of the sanctimonious bourgeoisie, the moneyed elite and the working class as they all mercilessly claw their way up and down the rickety and ruthlessly hierarchical Brazilian social ladder. -Harvard Film Archive	0.103347	/Af1LVeL0yCNGnmmwx4TYUOkHv8p.jpg	[]	[]	5/3/1963	0	100	[{'iso_639_1': 'pt', 'name': 'PortuguÃªs'}]	Released		Golden Mouth	FALSE	0	0

Most archaeologists today have concluded that there's no evidence that the Exodus of Israelite slaves from Egypt ever happened. Filmmaker Timothy Mahoney faces a crisis of faith: "Is this foundation event of the Bible really just a myth?" He embarks on a 12-year journey around the world to search for answers.  Patterns of Evidence: The Exodus unlocks the mystery of this ancient saga, combining a scientific investigation with a retelling of the Exodus story to reveal an amazing pattern of evidence matching the biblical account that may challenge our understanding of history. It features stunning animations, narration by Kevin Sorbo (God's not dead, Hercules: The Legendary Journey), interviews with leading archaeologists such as Israel Finkelstein, Kent Weeks, and David Rohl, and guest appearances by Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres.	0.261811	/4N29yXYVMOD0l9zHaCEdJCIXwp8.jpg	[{'name': 'Thinking Man Films', 'id': 65737}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	1/14/2015	0	115	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released	Patterns of Evidence is an engaging, visually pleasing and fascinating piece of filmmaking whatever one believes.

It is through them that we watch the events unfold. The infected, or inhabited, candy striper becomes predatory. She goes after men for sex and after women to spread. Infected women develop an incredible sweet tooth and devour anything sweet they can find. The horror then spreads. As the horror takes over more of the hospital and the CDC locks it down, the basketball players and a few friends do everything they can to try and get out of the hospital.

The ranch is left to Talbot's 12-year-old ward, Duke Lowery, much to the dismay of Talbot's niece, Jan Holloway. After some attempts on Duke's life, Roy finally proves that Jan, Steve McClory and coroner Jim Judnick had Talbot killed and are conspiring to do the same for Duke, making Jan the last heir.	0.012918	/eJ3cL6mtxVMLDzLGNvKfeEiw4nn.jpg	[{'name': 'Republic Pictures', 'id': 1432}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]	10/18/1946	0	72	[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released	Roy Knocks The West For A Singin', Lead-Slingin' Loop!
