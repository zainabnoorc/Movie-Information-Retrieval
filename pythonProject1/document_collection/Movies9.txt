A business trip to check on a project called â€œGalapagos in Greeceâ€ by the islanders and for which his bank extended a loan and credit, brought him there. Being a German, he wants to investigate thoroughly, but Panos, a mini-mart owner, and the mayor try their utmost to sabotage himâ€”to camouflage a not-so-good reality. After every single trial resulted in nothing because of the islandersâ€™ secret meddling, Jorgâ€™s trip becomes elongated, like The Odysseyâ€™s, forcing him to contemplate the priorities and responsibilities in life again.	1.30421	/8ZVUr8zlQhNoHi15RFuyk68a4m6.jpg	[{'name': 'Pantaleon Entertainment GmbH', 'id': 17465}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'GR', 'name': 'Greece'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'DE', 'name': 'Germany'}]	8/6/2015	0	89	[{'iso_639_1': 'de', 'name': 'Deutsch'}, {'iso_639_1': 'el', 'name': 'ÎµÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬'}]	Released		Highway to Hellas	FALSE	5.3	12

Jan had successfully bred dogs and birds and believed she could do the same with a different animal â€“ though she knew nothing about racing and had never been on a horse. Convincing a handful of locals to part with ten pound a week for her scheme, she found a thoroughbred mare with a terrible racing record for Â£300, a stallion past his best, put them together and â€“ against all the odds â€“ bred a winner.  Itâ€™s an audacious tale of luck and chance and beating the odds; a story of how a gaggle of working class folk from the Welsh Valleys took on the racing elite, broke through class and financial barriers, and brought hope and pride back to their depressed community.	1.92024	/b0hyVLGAD31L0yzjB4eKSavVc7f.jpg	[{'name': 'Channel Four Films', 'id': 181}, {'name': 'Film 4', 'id': 2335}, {'name': 'Picturehouse Entertainment', 'id': 11486}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}]	4/17/2015	0	86	[{'iso_639_1': 'es', 'name': 'EspaÃ±ol'}, {'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]	Released		Dark Horse	FALSE	3.7	23

The hundred or so children involved had never seen a movie, and in the workshop they see and learn about the cinema: photograms and moving images, projection, camera angles and movement, film genres, and much more. And they watch movies: Chaplin, Disney, Lamorisse's 'The Red Balloon,' the Lumieres' 'The Arrival of the Train to the Station.' Finally, each child designs his own film with drawings.

The sides of the box fall to the ground, but instead of containing the magician a lively clown steps forth who further mystifies the audience by causing the box to disappear, and in its place is seen a fully laid table with a smoking dinner, to which the clown applies himself. The table, however, suddenly disappears much to the astonishment of the clown, who is confronted by the magician in the garb of Mephistopheles. This he suddenly changes to that of a sculptor, and in the background is seen a pedestal with the bust of a young lady, which comes to life as the sculptor applies the mallet and chisel.	0.247933	/9E5I28UpWAVJ5YTGp5wSC9hhV6h.jpg	[{'name': 'Star-Film', 'id': 7159}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]	1898-01-01	0	1	[{'iso_639_1': 'xx', 'name': 'No Language'}]	Released		The Magician	FALSE	6.4	7

The injured man is EspÃ­rito da Luz Cardoso (literally â€œSpirit of the Lightâ€), a struggling composer whose sambas unite and uplift the marginalized Brazilian people in his midst. Based on the life of composer ZÃ© Keti â€“ who actually appears in the film as the popular singer Alaor â€“ EspÃ­ritoâ€™s story unfolds through flashbacks which overflow luxuriously with song, yet also expose the manifold divisions within Rioâ€™s social strata. A victim of exploitive businessmen who suck the life out of his music, EspÃ­rito witnesses each of his dreams dashed one at a time by unrelenting tragedy. - Harvard Film Archive	0.072383	/nPstb4nrXdFl189SkHq16zNA4bx.jpg	[]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'BR', 'name': 'Brazil'}]	8/26/1957	0	90	[{'iso_639_1': 'pt', 'name': 'PortuguÃªs'}]	Released		Rio, Zona Norte	FALSE	5	1

The film chronicles a day in the life of five peanut vendors from the favelas (shanty towns) of Rio de Janeiro. This was one of the first Brazilian films to address the issues of race, poverty, and class. These themes would continue to be examined by dos Santos throughout his career. â€“ JCRR, Cine Las Americas	0.192623	/j5MB8dUmheDht1f00tyE6RILVr0.jpg	[{'name': 'Equipe Moacyr Fenelon', 'id': 93194}]	[{'iso_3166_1': 'BR', 'name': 'Brazil'}]	8/24/1955	0	100	[{'iso_639_1': 'pt', 'name': 'PortuguÃªs'}]	Released		Rio 100 Degrees F.

He had a dream, to own a crystal set ( very early radio receiver) so as to listen to Bradman flay the Pom's ( English) in the upcoming Ashes Test match. However that took money to buy and times were hard. Fatty uses his enterprise to raise money and promptly loses it as misfortune strikes time and again. Then of course his arch rival Bruiser Murphy is also plotting Fatty's downfall. If he can only win the goat race again he will have enough to pay for the crystal set; or will Bruiser Murphy gazump him? With his band of friends plus Trumper the frog and Hector the goat Fatty sets out to win the day. Hurray for Fatty Finn.

You've never seen drummers like this before! Featuring Nasyr Abdul Al-Khabyyr, Dennis Chambers, Kenwood Dennard, Horacio "El-Negro" Hernadez, Giovanni Hidalgo, Mike Mangini and Raul Rekow, the film engages us with the rich music styles and influences that are as dynamic as the performers themselves. We are lifted to another dimension as we connect to the powerful forces of nature embodied in the music of these master musicians. The creative and spiritual freedom of expression these artists display is overwhelming - from Latin rhythms to the wildly original compositions of Kenwood Dennard. Rock, jazz, Latin fusion, soul - these master drummers have backed up the likes of Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Carlos Santana and now - each other.	0.09111	/vTOdvQJxE7kLps2sqypWL2F3uga.jpg	[]	[]	1/1/2010	0	84	[]	Released		A Drummer's Dream	FALSE	8	2

Jun's lack of an official identity and papers limits him to dead-end jobs (the gas station, handing out flyers, and eventually male prostitution) and leaves him always in fear of arrest and deportation. Hyeon, who is supposed to be available whenever his sugar daddy "needs" him, stifles in his up-market "prison". These two finally find each other through an Internet site, with disastrous results. The sudden convergence of their opposite lives gives Kim the cues he needs for a series of reflections on the implications of "statelessness".	0.101402	/2vCkKOXJir11Sfm4UIq7e5NyDyj.jpg	[]	[]	3/12/2012	0	119	[{'iso_639_1': 'ko', 'name': 'í•œêµ­ì–´/ì¡°ì„ ë§'}]	Released		Stateless Things	FALSE	6.5	2
